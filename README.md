The Chief Data Scientist of a city School District, Maria has been tasked with preparing data from the students' standardized test scores. This data will be used for analysis; which includes reporting and presenting to each school and district levels.
The objective is to further to analyze student funding and student standardized test scores. We have aggregated the data and showcased trends in school performance based on categories which will help the school board and superintendants make decision regarding school budgets and allocations.
